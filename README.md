## Introduction
Using React, Node.js, Express & MongoDB I have built a Full Stack MERN Application. The App is a simple social media app that allows users to post interesting events that happened in their lives.

## How to Run:
- Create a MongoDB database and collection and connet to it by specifying the MongoDB CONNECTION_URI in Index.js located inside the server. 
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the app
